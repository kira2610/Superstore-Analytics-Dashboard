# Superstore-Analytics-Dashboard

In this project I performed-

Data Integration: Analyzed data from an Excel workbook containing three tables: Orders, People, and Returns, to provide a comprehensive view of store performance.

Dashboard Development: Created a dynamic Tableau dashboard to visualize key metrics, including sales, profit, and the number of orders.

KPI Implementation: Defined and tracked three critical KPIs: Sales, Profit Margin, and Return Rate, providing insights into overall business health.

Calculated Fields: Developed calculated fields for Profit Margin and Return Rate, enhancing the dashboard's analytical capabilities.

Top Product Analysis: Utilized Tableau sets to highlight the top 5 products, facilitating targeted marketing and inventory decisions.

Parameter Functionality: Implemented parameter functionality to allow users to switch between metrics (Sales, Profit, and Number of Orders) dynamically, improving user experience and interactivity.
